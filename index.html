					<h4>
						Introduction and Aim
					</h4>
					<p>In our analysis we decided to study the phenomenon of road accidents. <br>
						We decided to choose this topic to underline their great frequency and importance in the impact of human life.<br>
						The main part of this project is to show the location where the accidents happened and the causes of the accidents.<br>
						The purpose of this project is to inform the population about the accidents frequency and to convince people to pay more attention to some aspects of that could cause an accident.<br>
						Our analysis also aims to make people understand how many mistakes humans can make, in this case while driving, and therefore
						the importance of finding a solution to reduce the number of annual accidents, through the development of cars thanks to the one of technology and AI.<br>
					</p>
					<h4>
						Source
					</h4>
					<p>
						Being the continent with the most information available, we decided to choose the American continent as the object of our analysis.<br>
						Having found a very reliable source and being the American territory very vast and diversified, we concentrated most of our analysis in the area next to the county of new york.<br>
						The dataset that we have considered in our analysis has been provided online as open-source by the Crash Record Center, from the state of New York.<br>
						<a href="https://data.world/data-ny-gov/e8ky-4vqe">Dataset Link</a>
					</p>
					<h4>
						Data pre-processing
					</h4>
					<p>To be able to have a more reliable analysis as close to reality as possible we decided to use more datasets, one from the years 2014 to 2016 and one from the year 2019 and 2020, unoftunately we haven't found the missed years (2017-2018) .<br>
						Furthermore for the creation of our data visualizations we got another dataset containing the counties coordinates and their population. <br>
						Fortunately the datasets we used are complete and we have had no managing problems since they don't contain many empty fields, so we could keep all the original data.<br>

						<p>The map above shows the total accidents of each countie.<br>
							As we can notice most of the accidents of our dataset happened in the State of New York and the ones around it</p>

						<h4>New york and nearby States accidents</h4>
						<p>Because of that we decide to take only the accidents that happened in the State of New York and the states around it.</p>

					<figure id="dropdown_contentC" class="figure" style="display:none">
						<h4>New york and nearby States accidents</h4>
						<p>To give a better idea of the accidents we decide to check the accidents that happened per county population.</p>

					<h4>
						Advices to avoid accidents.
					</h4>
					<p>
						As we can notice by the graph above it is possible to find when most accidents happened<br>
						Thanks to that we can give some advice to when to pay more attention to the driving:<br>
						- When the road is wet and grade.<br>
						- When there is snow or ice on the road.<br>
						- When is dark and there are not lights.<br>
						- When there is a curve.
